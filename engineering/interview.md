Hi ____,

I want to say thank you so much for the offer, I appreciate it very much, and I know how hard you worked to get it approved. I have enjoyed talking to ____ people, during the interviews, the lunch, and the phone conversations. I believe ____ will become even more successful and I know there would be an opportunity for me to make a lot of impact.
However, after much consideration, I feel like at this stage of my career I would feel more satisfied at another company. Their mission is also pretty strong and I enjoyed meeting their team as well. It is a very tough decision, and I will never be able to say for sure whether I'm making the right choice - there is no right or wrong choice anyway.
I hope there may be an opportunity for us to work together in the future. Thank you again!
Best regards,
_____
